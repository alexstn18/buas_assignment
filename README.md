# I Just Wanna Bounce - BUas CMGT (IGAD) Programming Intake Assignment 2023
This is my game for the 2023 Programming Intake for Breda University of Applied Sciences CMGT (IGAD)

Developed in close to 3 months, initially starting with barely any OOP knowledge and game development knowledge. I could express many things about this game, but it would take a while. So let me keep it relatively short... The whole process of creating this game was an amazing journey, in which I probably have learned more about programming than I ever did in my 3 years of studying Computer Science at high school. In this period, I have made a lot of friends through Jeremiah's (check credits) online lectures, and got to meet a few of them at the February Orientation Day for the Programming Track, which I consider to be the best day I have probably had in the past few years. Once again, thank you very much to everyone credited in the **1st part of the Credits** for this amazing journey.

# Summary
**I Just Wanna Bounce** is a 2D Platformer that heavily relies on bouncing, hence the theme **"Bounce"** for the intake assignments of this year. The main **objective** of the game is to finish all of the three levels, specifically, to get over the obstacles (spikes) and enter each level's portal. Optionally, the player can collect a coin in each level, three to be fair, to gain additional health. The amount of coins the player has collected will be shown in the finish screen. To make the game a bit more challenging, the player loses 5 health each bounce. If the player has died 25 times, the game will show a game over screen and allow the player to try all over again.
