# I Just Wanna Bounce - BUas CMGT (IGAD) Programming Intake Assignment 2023
This is my game for the 2023 Programming Intake for Breda University of Applied Sciences CMGT (IGAD)

Developed in close to 3 months, initially starting with barely any OOP knowledge. I could express many things about this game, but it would take a while. So let me keep it relatively short... The whole process of creating this game was an amazing journey, in which I probably have learned more about programming than I ever did in my 3 years of studying Computer Science at high school. In this period, I have made a lot of friends through Jeremiah's (check credits) online lectures, and got to meet a few of them, at the February Orientation Day for the Programming Track, which I consider to be the best day I have probably had in the past few years. Once again, thank you very much to everyone credited in the **1st part of the Credits** for this amazing journey.
